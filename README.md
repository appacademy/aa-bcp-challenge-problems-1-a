# Challenge Problems

These are problems to challenge you and prepare you for future interviews
and bootcamp evaluations, whether as a part of entrance interviews or
assessments during a bootcamp program.

## How to get the most out of these problems?

by these challenge problems it is recommended to time yourself while completing
them!

In any kind of interview or assessment you will not have unlimited time. Being
